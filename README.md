# SCSS PRACTICAL PROJECT 

A Landing Page Built Using Html and scss.
This project was built to help test my knowledge on scss.

# Every part of the project code contains an understanding of:

* Mixin (PASSING ARGUMENTS IN MIXING).

* Nesting in scss.

* The use of variables.

* Loops (was mostly used toloop through a list and map to generate utility classes).

* Mapping and Lists (to store key and value data pair which were later looped through to develop classes and properties).

* Partials (helps to break down your file into smaller proportions and making use of @import to link the partial file to the base scss file).
